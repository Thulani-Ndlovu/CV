 <div class="About Me">
    <p><em> Electrical Engineering Student at <a href="https://www.wits.ac.za/">Wits University</a> </em></p>
    <p>I am an Electrical Engineering student at The University of the Witwatersrand
       in Johannesburg, South Africa. I have since developed an interest in Software
       Development, hence the enrolment in the Software Engineering course at ALX Africa 
       and Full Stack Web development course at Udemy.
